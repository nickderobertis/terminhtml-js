Convert HTML blocks with terminal output into animated terminals

## Install

```bash
npm install terminhtml
```

## Usage

### Basic Usage

First, define the contents of the terminal in HTML. Separate each line with a newline,
and prefix commands with `$ `. Output does not need a prefix.

```html
<pre id="my-terminal">
$ echo woo
woo
</pre>
```

Then reference this HTML via CSS selector in the TerminHTML constructor,
and call `init`.

```js
import { TerminHTML } from "terminhtml";

const term = new TerminHTML("#my-terminal");
term.init();
```

See [this example on CodePen](https://codepen.io/nickderobertis/pen/dydOjra).

### Advanced Usage

See the type definitions for TerminHTML, there are many options you can pass to
customize the input and output.

TerminHTML JS also retains the formatting of child elements, so you can have full
color support. It also has handling for carriage returns to produce animations, delays to get
realistic timing of output, and prompts with user input.
Typically, this more advanced HTML structure is generated by [TerminHTML Python](https://nickderobertis.github.io/terminhtml/) while recording a local terminal session, but it can also be created manually
or via a separate generator.

See [an advanced example on CodePen](https://codepen.io/nickderobertis/pen/mdXOGJd)

## Development Status

This project uses [semantic-release](https://github.com/semantic-release/semantic-release) for versioning.
Any time the major version changes, there may be breaking changes. If it is working well for you, consider
pegging to the current major version, e.g. `terminhtml@v1`, to avoid breaking changes. Alternatively,
you can always point to the most recent stable release with the `terminhtml@latest`.

## Developing

Clone the repo and then run `npm install` to set up the pre-commit hooks.

Run `npm run dev` to start the development server, and `npm run build` to create a production build
of the library.

The library files are stored in `src`, while the files for the development page are in `dev-src`.
